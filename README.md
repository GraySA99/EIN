# InternshipSummer2019
Inventory Software I wrote during my Summer 2019 Internship. Can be ran straight from the folder
Required Libraries:
  <br />tkinter,
  <br />ttkthemes,
  <br />tempfile,
  <br />win32api,
  <br />requests,
  <br />tkcalendar,
  <br />babel,
  <br />babel.numbers,
  <br />math,
  <br />hashlib,
  <br />datetime,
  <br />mysql.connector,
  <br />base64,
  <br />os,
  <br />win32print,
  <br />sqlite3,
  <br /><br />
  User Note: Some features of this program do not work due to not being hooked up to an actual organizations database. For instance, reconnecting to server does nothing because the database is a local sqlite database. <br />
  <br />
  Usage: run <br /> ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br />
  then <br /> ```python '.\EIN Inventory Software.py'```
